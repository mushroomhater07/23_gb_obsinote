data that is collected on such a large scale that it cannot easily be analysed
machine learning techniques to discern patterns in the data

Not DB => volume + variety

Finding patterns
Volume: TOo bif to handled by one server => distrubuted multi ser
Velocity: streaming dataflow in responds in fast time
Variety :  unstructured form, text media

Distributed Processing: The principle of spreading large and complex tasks over a number of computers or servers.

FP: => process instantly, parrallel
_solution to the problem in multiple machine_
- Immutable data structures = cannot be inadvertently altered in a function
- Stateless, so the program’s behaviour does not depend on the order in which functions are called    [no side effect]
- Higher-order functions: MapFold [easier to write, distrubuted, efficeint code]

fact - a piece of data that 
-  immutable, cannot be deconstructed further
- no redundant info
- specific time, is timestamped
Fact based model - captures a single piece of information
