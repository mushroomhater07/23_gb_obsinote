# Functional Programming
 #bigdata  f(g(x))

## Programming paradigm
 > programming paradigm is a style of programming

 - Procedural → the multiline procedure
 - OOP → object as instant of a class
 - Declarative → find specific data → state what needs to be done
### Functional paradigm
>functional program → series of functions
 Each function takes in some data as argument and return an output
 a lot common with maths

FP is a solution to the problem of processing data over multiple machines 
FP are stateless(no side effect)
FP support higher order functions. Attributes are what makes it easier to write correct efficient distributed code with FP and procedural programming techniques
high order function mapping
make use of immutable data structure

### Declarative paradigm
 _declarative describe the logic of the problem that need to be solved.
 Language implementation carries out computation
 Functional program specify what need to perform rather than how
 
### Function (in Haskell)
#set #vector
Haskell:  `squareNumber x = x * x
Maths:    `f: A → B
function is a rule that fir eacg element  in some set A chosen in set B
> a function f has a function type
> `f: A→B` (A=args, B=result)
> A=domain B=co-domain 
> Both domain and co domain are subset of object in some data type>
#### Domain and Co-domain
THe domain is a set from which the function's input value are chosen
co-domain a set from which the funtions output value are chosen. Not all of the co domain meberneed to be output

`f: (a,b,c … z) → {0,1,2… 25}
`A = {-10, -9 … 0 … 9, 10}
`B={100,81….81,100}` set cannot be repeating
{0..81,100} //delete repeating unity

### Composition of function
Maths: g( f(x) )
Computer Science:  g `o` f

## Haskell
typeclasses = type
function can work eith different type

Function
•Functions are used as the fundamental building blocks (unlike in other paradigms where objects, procedures, etc. are used)

•Statements are written as a series of functions

•Each statement accepts input data as arguments and returns an output

•Statelessness & immutability

•

•Leaving the program stateless (i.e.no record of previous interactions and each interaction request has to be handled based entirely on information that comes with it)

•No side effects à  A procedure will have side effects, not functions.

### Benefit
-   Supporting the decomposition and abstraction of computing problems into **functions** that are made up of other functions that are made up of other functions, and so on
-   Being suitable for **running parallel and concurrent program execution**, which allows functional programs to run on multiprocessor systems
