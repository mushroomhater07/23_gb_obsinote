assessment\nApparatus list and diagram (Read 2d - select the appropriate equipment!) \n Synthesis method (provided)  Ethanol + Acetic acid → ethyl ethanoate + water //esterification\nPurification method (You need to plan this. Including the amounts/volumes of material used)\n\nPropan-1-ol (50 cm3 ) and ethanoic acid (50 cm3 ) are mixed thoroughly in a 250 cm3 round-bottomed flask.\n\nConcentrated sulfuric acid (10 cm3 ) is added drop by drop to the mixture, keeping the contents of the flask well-shaken and cooled in an ice-water bath.\nWhen the acid has all been added, a reflux condenser is fitted to the flask and the mixture gently boiled over an electric heating mantle for about 30 minutes.\nThe mixture is cooled, and the apparatus rearranged for distillation. The crude ester (about 60 cm3 ) is distilled off.\n\nSeperating funnel\n\nThe distillate is placed in a separating funnel and shaken with about half its volume of 30% sodium carbonate solution, with the pressure being released at intervals. The lower aqueous layer is then discarded.\nThe crude ester is shaken in a separating funnel with about half its volume of 50% calcium chloride solution, which removes unreacted alcohol. The lower layer is discarded.\nThe ester is run into a clean, dry flask containing some anhydrous calcium chloride and swirled.[appear clear]\n\ndistill 2\n\nThe ester is filtered into a clean, dry flask, with a few anti- bumping granules, and distilled. The fraction boiling between 100°C and 103°C is collected Distillation\n\nResults and observations (density, Yield, colour, and states of matter) Mass ethyl ethanoate `Mr = 12_4 + 16_2+6 = 48+38= 86gmol-1\n\nAnalysis (compare experimental results to researched literature data, values, and observations. Remember to reference the data source with date and time used).\n\nPlease refer to the following link to assist you in preparing for this practical. \n\nThe boiling point of ethyl ethanoate is 74.1°C.\nThe boiling point of water is 100°C.\nCalcium chloride and anhydrous sodium sulfate are both effective desiccants.\n\nboiling point test\n"},"SUMMARY.html":{"url":"SUMMARY.html","title":"summary","keywords":"","body":"Table of contents\n\nintro\npurify\nsummary\ntodo\nubuntu\nuntitled\n01_save\n2021-06-03\n2021-06-04\nfire man\nfood\nhearing aid\nlove man\non9 host fam\n*\nrequirement\nrice purity-win-ui44oig4p98\nrice purity\nsave\nsort email\nsunfc\ntpomps-win-ui44oig4p98\ntpomps\ntravel advice-win-ui44oig4p98\ntravel advice\n中国社会最新阶层划分模型\n什麼是「食豆腐」？\n婆婆\n警世長文\n\n\n02_learning\nandroid beginner-win-ui44oig4p98\nandroid beginner\nasp.net\nc++\ncsharp vs vb\ndiagrams in obsidian\nhacking for dummies\nhome router\nhtml\nkotlin-win-ui44oig4p98\nkotlin\n*\nself-hosted (docker\nsexual constent\nsocket.io\nsprital day\nvbnet\nvdi vs idv vs diskless node\n\n\n03_randomsheep\n- ad\n- as a human\n- bash\n- ccna\n- cv advise\n- devops + git\n- docker\n- kubernetes vs docker\n- loadbalancer vs reverse proxy\n- nfs vs zfs vs san\n- rds\n- react\n- rust\n- wireshark, netcat\ncs in action\nfi accountancy\ninterview day\njavascript\nmoney flow\nopencore setup\npoe lan\nrandom name\n*\nsetup proxmox\nsex determine -
