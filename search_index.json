\n1级：以在任委员、退休常委为代表，和2的区别在于，1对全国局势有控制能力，2没     有。  \n2级：以在任实权省部级干部、退休委员、部分大权贵、大富商、大银行家为代表。     和3的区别在于，2能影响国家政策，3不能。  \n3级：以一般省部、副省部、特别实权的局级，或是大企业主、一般权贵富商、名牌     大学校长、中等银行家为代表。和4的区别在于，3能够影响一个地区或者行业     的发展，4不能。3以马云、马化腾等为体制外的顶峰，3其实是行业精英或地区     体制精英。  \n1―3级是中国的上层社会，普通人非奇遇不能进。\n4级：以一般地厅级、实权县处级、院士、大教授、高级职业经理人、名医生、名律     师、高校校长、演艺明星、知名作家、中等企业主、小银行家之类为主。普通     人通过奋斗最多能够达到这个层次。比如惠普谷歌大中国区总裁、范冰冰之类     就是体制外本级的顶峰。4和5的区别在于，4和上层有千丝万缕的联系，5没有。  \n5级：以小企业主、普通处级副处级或实权科级干部、教授、中等职业经理人、大城     市多套房地主、二三线明星、小有名气的医生、律师、工程师等。5和6的区别     在于，5有自己的事业，6没有。  \n6级：以普通公务员、主流企业职员、高校青年教师、普通自由职业者、一般医生律     师、一般工程师、大点的个体户等为主。名牌大学生、研究生毕业后多在这个     层次。6和7的区别在于，6有一定的上升空间，7很难。  \n4―6级是中国的中层社会，分别是高、中、低端中产阶级，普通人通过努力，最后能\n够定格在第5级就算是很不错了。  \n7级：以普通企业工人、边缘化的体制内人员、小个体户、城市底层土著、富裕农民     之类为代表。7和8的区别在于，7能够在大中城市立足，8不能。  \n8级：以血汗工厂工人、普通农民等为代表。8和9的区别在于，8能够自食其力，9不     能。  \n9级：以大城市底层失业人口、偏远山区农民等为代表，以城市的基本生活标准要求，     这些人在城市基本不能自食其力。  \n7―9级是中国社会的底层，是草根阶层。\n金字塔型的社会结构\n\n中层远小于底层，比如印度；\n纺缍型的社会\n底层少中层多(上层哪儿都少)，比如美国。  \n\n需要特别说明的是，即使在同一级别，体制内与体制外不仅仅社会地位有很大差别，在其他政治、经济等各个层面也差别甚大。  \n毫无疑问，1―3级是上层，是统治阶层，是最大的既得利益者，是可以从经济发展中切下最大蛋糕的阶层。而4―6级大致属于中产阶级。他们可以分享经济发展的成果，但是比例很小。其中，5级是可以分享经济成果的最低阶层。很自然，6―9就是贡献青春和劳动价值的人啦。尤其是7―8级，基本没有上升空间，在社会上也就混口饭吃，是绝对数量最大的一个人群。由于这个人群无法向上流动，只能向下流动，但是向下流动，只能流到9级，而9级数量过大则会影响社会稳定，不要问为什么，想想陈水总，你就啥都明白了。  \n过去20年的历史表明，在现有的体制下，财富再分配方式只能在4、5、6与7、8之间展开，比如，提高最低工资标准，就是把4、5、6级的蛋糕分配一部分给7、8。至于1-3任何时候都是最大的既得利益者，指望从1-3中切蛋糕来分配给4-6或者7-8是不可能的――所以，在任何时候，我对实质性的减税不报任何希望。至于印钞就更好玩了，这是1-3级无条件对4-8级剪羊毛。  \n而社会阶层的固化，是金字塔结构的另一个重要的特征。在这样的社会结构里，个人奋斗远远不如人脉更重要。有一个好爹当然是最理想的，如果没有，靠钻营、靠献身――或者说“我不要脸了”，也有机会获得层面更高的人提携。无数事实证明，层面更高的人士提携比个人奋斗更容易爬到更高的阶层。5-6级如果有4级体制内或者3级以上的人提携，很容易到达4级。7-8级如果有4级以上的人提携，也很容易到达5-6级。总体上来说，7-8阶层是没有希望的阶层，即使有个什么机遇，他们也没有人脉和资金来把握这个机遇。而9级是这个社会最悲惨的阶层，这个阶层没有任何福利，收入很低甚至为0，如果在城市只能啃老，在农村只能苟延残喘。  \n请对照一下，看看你自己目前隶属于哪一级；通过努力，将来有希望上升到哪一级；遭遇失业，不幸会下降到哪一级。想清楚了，或许能更好地帮助自己做好各种人生规划，包括职业、理财与保险。  \n那么，这样的金子塔结构怎么保持稳定呢？\n\n最基本的统治模式就是：保、拉、压、控、放。  \n\n1-3级的利益是保，否则统治阶级内部就要分裂，团结是第一位的。  \n第4级是拉。社会精英要拉拢，因为他们有一定的影响力也掌握了一定的资源，为了稳定，这个阶层都得进人大、政协，有什么诉求“内部协商”。  \n5―6级是压。普通人比较优秀者一般到这个位置几乎就是天花板了，社会几乎没有给予他们提供更多的上升空间，对于这些阶层创造财富的热情以及上升的欲望，得到的是沉重的压制――每当这些阶层积累一定的财富时，新的政策或者游戏规则出台，积累的财富被一只看不见的手切走了。  \n7―8级是控。所谓的控就是一方面是有保有打，另一方面就是控制流动。7―8级没有上升空间，在社会上也就混口饭吃，是绝对数量最大的一个人群。由于这个人群无法向上流动，只能向下流动，但是向下流动到9级――9级数量过大会影响社会稳定。所以一定要控制流动――怎么控制？宏观经济政策上包括著名的“保增长、控通涨”，包括提高最低工资标准、强制社保（从4、5、6级的财富中切下一块分配给8-9级），除了胡萝卜也有大棒――从城管到暴力机关，对抗与冲突的事件基本都在这个阶层。  \n9级是放。放是放弃的意思。这个阶层只有在过年过节，才有可能得到官员作秀的一点点可怜的慰问品。  \n这种统治模式在经济基本面不出大问题的情况下是有益于社会稳定的――即使这个社会充斥着腐败、不公正也不会出现大的问题。这种成熟的模式即使是一个强势的人物也不能轻易改变。  \n比如西红柿，他试图创造另一种模式――即打压第4级，然后将第4级的财富分配给8-9级。虽然他在普通民众中获得很高的支持度。但是，他忽略了4级的能量――他们可是与上层有千丝万缕的联系――或者也可以认为他们是上层在这个阶层的利益代言人。最后，强势的西红柿也只能悲催了。  \n这里必须强调的是，财富再分配只能在4、5、6与7、8之间展开，1-3级是不会动的，甚至在4、5、6中体制内人士也不会动他们的利益（这也是要增加一个体制轴的原因）。比如，提高最低工资标准，就是把4、5、6级的蛋糕分配一部分给7、8，强制社保，不仅是把4、5、6级的蛋糕分配一部分给7、8，还要多切一块分配给4、5、6中的体制内。这些手段一方面是安抚7、8，防止7、8流动到9，另一方面就是压制5、6。至于印钞就更好玩了，这是1-3级无条件对4-8级剪羊毛――当然，也会拿出一小部分来给7-8，比如，提高退休职工工资标准。  \n法律\n毫无疑问，法律是为统治阶层服务的，具体的说就是为1―3服务，这个服务的边缘就是第4级以及5级中的体制内，法律的鸿沟在4-5之间。当不涉及1-4级时，法律是相对公正的，也受到舆论较大的影响――具体参见吴虹飞案。特别要强调的是，在4级以上特别是1-3级的纠纷，都不会通过法律解决――因为上层都明白，那玩意就是骗4级以下的老百姓。上层的纠纷是实力对比喝讲茶，这个层面讲法律传出去是要被笑话的。  \n至于所有P民们寄予厚望的改革，公报大家都可以看，就是继续小心地骑自行车，绝对没有赶紧换成汽车的意思。如果有什么病，吃点药是必须的，但最好是不打针，至于做手术，那就别想了。  \n因为1-3要的是维稳，4级改革的欲望也很低。5-6阶层是创业和改革热情最高的阶层，但绝对没有话语权。  \n知道GDP为什么要保8吗？保增长保就业，真正的原因是要保证第8级的人群不能掉进第9级。哈哈。现在这个目标调整为7.5――意思就是至少要保证8级中有一半的人不掉进9。至于底限是7，意思是如果保不住8级，也不允许7级掉入9。  \n说到底，最受关注的还是7-8啊，如果真有啥大动作，估计也就是4-6级买单。  \n各个阶层复杂的心态\n1-3无疑是最大的既得利益者，这个阶层另一个特点就是利益可以世袭――只要社会保持稳定，他们的子子孙孙就可以稳定的待在这个阶层继续成为最大的既得利益者。所以，这个阶层最讨厌变化，最喜欢的就是稳定。所以，即使在体制内，政绩什么的都可以排在后面――维稳才是真正的一票否决。在这个意义上至上而下真正的改革出现的可能性很小，除非有一个政治人物同时具备2点特征：第一，他能超越自己与家族的利益；第二，他能找到同类的伙伴能冲破强大的既得利益者束缚。在和平时期，我对出现这样的人物几乎不抱任何希望，在动荡时期出现这样的人物倒有可能，但是更大的可能就是他是一个极右的野心家――这对整个民族几乎是最差的选项。  \n4级改革的欲望很低――如果不是没有的话。因为他们本身也是既得利益阶层，而且与上层也有千丝万缕的联系。更重要的是，他们能够成为4级也与这些“千丝万缕的联系”脱不了干系。他们关心宏观政策的走向，但是他们更相信体制朋友给的内幕消息。从整个阶层而言，他们是比较稳定而且安全的――前提是没有成为同级体制内或者更高阶层的对立面，否则他们掌握的财富就成了别人眼中的最丰盛的蛋糕。典型的例子参考曾远志案件。在复杂的政治斗争中，这个阶层的体制外部分人最容易成为牺牲品――与权力结合固然是发财的捷径，但同时也怀抱炸弹。所以，这个阶层的人士一般在政治上都非常谨慎――在商言商，不谈政治――比较典型的例子如马云、柳传志。在这个意义上，王石、任志强才是令人钦佩的。基于上述原因，这个阶层的人是最没安全感的，所以，也是移民比例最高的人群。  \n5-6阶层是创业热情最高的阶层。他们没有与上层“千丝万缕的联系”，只有靠分析宏观形势与政策来寻找机遇。他们想打破天花板所以也有很强的改革愿望。但是现实的犬儒主义使这些阶层大多数人选择观望――顶多是在言论上呼吁。他们一方面羡慕4级以上阶层的生活，另一方面在更低阶层中找到优越感，这种复杂的情绪让这些阶层的人群充斥着一种浮躁的心态。需要强调的是律师这个人群，4、5、6阶层都有，但是改革的欲望更强烈甚至是第一个真正意义上能行动起来的人群。其更本的原因就在于，只有改革至少是司法独立，律师才能获得更大的发展――在司法不公正或者腐败的的情况下，律师生存的空间只会越来越狭窄。所以律师为社会公正、司法公正的呼吁与行动更大意义上是为自己的命运做抗争。  \n7-8阶层是最没有希望的阶层。他们没有上升的空间，没有人脉、积蓄很少甚至没有。他们可能一辈子都在为一套房子在奋斗。他们不关心宏观经济形势与政策――因为这些与他们无关。即使有个什么机遇，他们也没有任何资源（人脉、资金）来把握这个机遇。最不公平的是――他们几乎没有任何福利来保障自己的基本生活。他们没有安全感――事实上每当经济低迷或者恶化，他们有很大一部分将跌到最悲惨的9级。他们渴望一夜暴富――买彩票是少数可能实现他们这个愿望的途径――另一个途径就是绑大款，做二奶（比如美美同学）。在一个惟利是图的世俗社会为了财富与利益他们大多数人可以毫不犹豫的付出自己的一切――人格、尊严。他们渴望改变很多人甚至在祈求动乱――这2个阶层充满着一股暴戾之气。  \n9级是这个社会最悲惨的阶层。在全球还没有几个国家象这里直接将一个阶层作为弃子。权贵们可以慷慨的对外拿出大笔援助，却舍不得给予这个阶层一个铜板。这个阶层没有任何福利，收入很低甚至为0，如果在城市只能啃老，在农村只能苟延残喘。这个阶层是最不安分的阶层，如果说7―8两个阶层充满着一股暴戾之气，那么9就是直接铤而走险――80%以上的刑事案件的罪犯都来自这个阶层\n"},"01_save/什麼是「食豆腐」？.html":{"url":"01_save/什麼是「食豆腐」？.html","title":"什麼是「食豆腐」？","keywords":"","body":"KEA最近有個廣告，是賣豆腐味軟雪糕的。廣告的標語是「只要你鍾意隨時都可以嚟食我豆腐」。\n我聽過「食豆腐」，因為我是個中佬，年紀不大也不小，即是出街會被小朋友叫叔叔那種。\n為什麼要強調年紀？因為我想指出，「食豆腐」是我對上的老一輩的說法。老一輩即是現在都已退休那一輩。\n小時候聽大人說「某男人食某女人豆腐」、「某女人俾人食豆腐」，我問阿媽什麼是食豆腐，阿媽說即是調戲。\n長大了一點，開始明白食豆腐的語境跟調戲是不同的。食豆腐是言語上或動作上佔女人便宜，那exactly就是性騷擾，例如語帶相關的性暗示，例子是在茶餐廳叫餐飲時，一個咸濕伯父對中女待應說「我想飲你啲奶......茶」。\n食豆腐所形容的情況，不是唐伯虎點秋香，也不是韓劇俊男壁咚美女，而是港產三級片裡面何家駒言語或小動作上咸濕鍾淑慧。\n何家駒搞鍾淑慧的圖實在太令人反胃，所以我貼另一張比較沒那麼嘔心的圖，那是《龍咁威2》裡面鄭中基跟麵檔女角們說要「吞精」。那也是食豆腐，食豆腐的重點是旁人見到會覺得厭惡。\n那麼，IKEA用「食我豆腐」做雪糕廣告口號好不好？\n我對性別議題不算很敏感，但我立即就想到茶餐廳那些咸濕伯父／麻甩佬……如果主動邀請人食其豆腐，我想起有些茶餐廳會有些主動情挑咸濕伯父的待應阿姨，或者是屯門公園引阿伯食豆腐的黑色呢士大媽。\n食雪糕？不了。\n"},"01_save/婆婆.html":{"url":"01_save/婆婆.html","title":"婆婆","keywords":"","body":"成日係我最堅強嘅後盾我貪佢走出去我返嚟有咩事都好陪我返學放學食沙嗲牛肉包有幾多留喺屋企度做To

Engine circo, dot, neato, osage, or twopi are supported. Default engine is dot.\n\n\nVega and Vega-lite\nMarkdown Preview Enhanced supports vega and vega-lite static diagrams.\n\nCode block with vega notation will be rendered by vega.\nCode block with vega-lite notation will be rendered by vega-lite.\nBoth JSON and YAML inputs are supported.\n\n\nYou can also @import a JSON or YAML file as vega diagram, for example:\n@import \"your_vega_source.json\" {as=\"vega\"}\n@import \"your_vega_lite_source.json\" {as=\"vega-lite\"}\n\nDitaa\nMarkdown Preview Enhanced supports ditaa that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art ('drawings' that contain characters that resemble lines like | / - ), into proper bitmap graphics.\n(Java is required to be installed)\nditaa is intergrated with code chunk, for example:\n  ```ditaa {cmd=true args=[\"-E\"]}\n  +--------+   +-------+    +-------+\n  |        | --+ ditaa +--> |       |\n  |  Text  |   +-------+    |diagram|\n  |Document|   |!magic!|    |       |\n  |     {d}|   |       |    |       |\n  +---+----+   +-------+    +-------+\n      :                         ^\n      |       Lots of work      |\n      +-------------------------+\n  ```\n\nshift-enter to run code chunk. set {hide=true} to hide code block. set {run_on_save=true} to render ditaa when you save the markdown file.\n\n\n\nIf you don't want to render graphs but only display code block, then you can add {code_block=true} like blow:\n```mermaid {code_block=true}\n// your mermaid code here\n```\n\nYou can set attributes for the container of the diagram. For example:\n```puml {align=\"center\"}\na->b\n```\nwill put the puml diagram at the center of preview.\n\nWhen you export your markdown file to GFM Markdown, the diagrams will be saved as png images to your imageFolderPath defined in package settings. You can control the exported image filename by declaring {filename=\"your_file_name.png\"}.\nFor example:\n```mermaid {filename=\"my_mermaid.png\"}\n...\n```\n➔ TOC\n"},"02_learning/Hacking for
