Aromatic compound

-   structure and bonding of benzene
    
    Benzene and phenol
    
    -   nitrite
    -   NO23, NH3
N atom has less replusion between p-orbital electrons than O atoms.
-COO- ethyl butanoate
acid/alikaline hydrolysis of nitrite/ alcohol/ester/ cooh
acyl chloride
test for alicycle/ pphenol
bromine
test for alcohol /aldehyde
tollen test
246DNF
+HBr -> tertiary > secondary > primary
Cahn-Ingold-order
bond enthalpy → make bond exothermic (-ve)
oxidation iloss(+), reduce igain (-)
slow rate determine → rate order

Find out chiral

Do Ionic equation and cancel// if change state


Recrystallsation
1. soluble when heat
2. cooled before purified
3. melting point of purified substance is usually higher
benzene activation 2,4,6 (with phenol too)

IR and NMR spectrum

bond connection and position curly arrow
oxidiation condition and apparatus

nuclear magnectic resonance 
major , minor, reversible product
Benzene delocalised with 5 other
Phenol have lone pair on o2 or oh
Cyclo localised between 2 c
Benzene low density cannot polarise
More stable than cyclo. Less energy to start an reaction
P orb overlap up and down
Pi bond and electron delocalised
Planar 120 bond length same
Electron density increase
Electrophille more attract to
Easily induced
