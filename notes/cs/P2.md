# Paper 2

- Database RDBMS
    - redundancy
    - inconsiitency
    - reduced data integrity
- JSON vs XML -

     standardise communication between server and client
    
    - understand
    - create
    - parse, native JavaScript + array
    - compact, expensive use?
    - data type
- SQL - Normalisation 3nf
  1. no repeating element / multiple in one record
  2. partial dependencies on compound key
  3. no dependencies on non key attribute
- Websocket
    - consist permant connection on TCP
    - real time
    - full duplex
    - no packet needed make use of space
- Client server
NAT port forwarding
DHCP
RoutablE ip > NAT
Ipv4 vs ipv6
- Structure of ip
    AND operation IP and Subnet Mask = Network ID
    AND operation IP and NOT(Subnet Mask) = Client ID
- Packet switching
 (check network id)
    - Within LAN
        1. AND subnet mask
        2. compare
        3. same > find subnet ID
        4. not same send through router by packet
    - Packet switching
        1. sent independenty
        2. set sequence number
        3. hop forward until reach ( write different destination IP on Network ID
        4. depences on conjestion ( difference 
        5. hierchary order
- Csma/cs rts cts
    1. check channel clear or not
    2. send RTS if CTS recieved , data transmitted

- Overflow

    result of a calculation
    is a number that is too large to store
    in the avaliable storage space / number of bits

- Vector bitmap

    Individual objects can be edited
the image can be enlarged / scaled without loss of quality
 less file size(Large)images can be composed of relatively few objects 
    // there will be fewer objects than there would be pixels // a single object might be equivalent to many pixels;

- MIDI
    Music represented as sequence of MIDI (event) messages;
    •   Channel;
    •   Note on / note off;
    •   Pitch / frequency / note number;
    •   Volume / loudness;
    •   Velocity;
    •   Key pressure / aftertouch;
    •   Duration / length;
    •   Timbre;
    •   Instrument;
    •   Pedal effects;
    •   Pitch bend;
    •   Note envelope;
    MIDI messages are usually two or three bytes long;
    First byte of each MIDI message is a status byte (others are data bytes);
    Bit rate is 31,250 bits per second;
    MSB value of 1 indicates status byte, 0 indicates data bytes;
    Status bytes are divided into a command and a channel number (4 bits for each); Sixteen channels are supported;

ADC
    - Analogue signal **A.** sound as BOD) sampled at fixed/regular time intervals
    -  **R.** references to graphs
    - Amplitude/Voltage of signal/wave measured
    - (at each sample point) 
    -  Measurement coded into a fixed number of bits // coded in binary

- Floating VS Fixed?
    
    Floating: greater range ( more number
    
    Fixed: better for calculation
    
    Represents all numbers to a constant 
    
    fixed, precision/accuracy;
    
**Advantage of floating point (max 1):**
(In a given number of bits) a floating point system can represent numbers with a greater range than a fixed point system;
**A.** can represent numbers much closer to zero // can represent much smaller numbers
**A.** can represent much larger numbers
**Advantage of fixed point (max 1):**
(In a given number of bits) a fixed point system can represent (some) numbers more precisely than a floating point system; **A.** “accurately” for “precision” as **BOD**
Calculations can be performed more quickly; **NE.** time efficient; **A.** simpler evaluation
Represents all numbers to a constant (**A.** fixed, guaranteed) level of precision/accuracy;

- Why rounding error?
    There are not enough bits in the mantissa, 
    only 7 bits is not enough to represent 28.25 exactly // the binary representation of 28.25 has more than 7 significant digits // the binary representation of 28.25 has more significant digits than there are bits in the mantissa // binary representation of 28.25 needs 8 bits (in mantissa) / has 8 significant digits // insufficient (bits) of precision available;
    **R.** 28.25/some numbers can never be represented exactly in binary
    It could be rounded to the nearest representable value // it may be truncated // represent as 28 // represent as 28.5;
    **R.** an error would be generated
- DHCP
    no need for expert to config host
    reduce time to config
    avoid duplicate IP

-  non routable ip address 
    which need a NAT to translate into a routable address before able to communicate => pass on to the internet

encryption =   (Using an algorithm) to convert a message into a form that is not understandable (without the key to decrypt it);
(Using an algorithm) to convert a message into a form that is only understandable by the intended parties // can only be read with the correct key;
(Using an algorithm) to convert a message into cipher text;

maritissa 1 . 000000    exponent 0111 (right)

Record locking - when a transaction start, it locked out until release
Timestamp - timestamp generated - result in loss of data integrity or incosistency cause if read and write

Digital signature Vs digital certificate

Certificate - a public key that publish by CA ensure you are real person

Baud rate, no of changes in one second
