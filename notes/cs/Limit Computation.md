Computable problem 
	→ if there is an algoruthm that can solve every instance of ti in finite number of steps 
Non-computable problems
	cannot be solved algorithmcally [Turning machine in 1936]
Computational problem 
	→ theoretically soluble by computer but if they take millions of years to solve, they are, in a practical sense, insoluble
Brute force method (n!)
	all possible method are tested 
TSP (n!) => optimisation problem

tractable prob 
	polynomial time or better
	worst-case solution that is reasonable
Intractable
	no resonable time solution
computationally hard
	Intractable problems are considered to be this

decidable vs undecidable
	A decision problem for which there is/no an algorithm that solves it

halting problem
	An undecidable problem that has two inputs – a program and an input to the program – and determines if the given program would terminate with the given input
	•This is the problem of determining for a given input, whether a program will finish running or continue for ever
Input i → Does program P halt on input i → Yes / No
	not possible to devise a program to show/give any program or input to halt or continue forever
	it show there are some problems that cannot be solved by computer

non-computable
	An algorithmic problem that has no algorithm that solves it

computationally unsolvable
	A non-algorithmic problem
Heuristic methods 
	•Not all intractable problems are equally hard
	•Not all instances of an intractable problem are equally hard
	•It may be relatively easy to get an approximate answer that is good enough
heuristic approach
	tries to find a solution which may not be perfect but which is adequate for its purpose
	- decision making (•Using a ‘rule of thumb’
	•Making an ‘educated guess’
	•Using common sense)
	ignore some relevant info
