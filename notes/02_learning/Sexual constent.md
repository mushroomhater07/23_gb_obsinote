## Scenario
- crush?
- partner have diff. limit

## Constent != silence
1. Everyone is clear (and happy)
2. Free to say no (without pressure or hassled or manipulated, drunk, passed out, asleep)
3.  Be honest (sex history/ have sex with other)
4. Constent once != forever
5. Connection. respect → relax and enjoy

1. Wanna show me your bedroom?
2. Show me where you want me to touch
3. Help me to take the clothes off
4. Can I take your shirt off
5. Try sth different?

Dealing with rejection/ sexual frustration → with respect
I miss you, send me pic?
Dont ask something they would feel sad - why not
Not to make people feel sad for saying no
No one like to be pushed to do if they dont want to
Pressure → ruin a relationship

## Handle rejection with respect 
- save face
- nobody get hurt

## Situation when someone really not all there (out of it)
→ you seems pretty wasted (drunk)
→ not active choice

## Both parties really truly into whats going on
!guilty
!pressure

## Communication could be body language
- leaning in? kissing you back?
- pulling away? staying kill of still
