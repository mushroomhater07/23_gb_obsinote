# statistics

*   census

    measure every member of population

    * takes time and expensive
    * accurate result
*   sampling unit

    individual of a population
*   sampling frame

    list of sampling unit
* Random

| simple random | same chance of being selected use random number generator                                       | Bias free           | need sampling frame           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| systematic    | take every kth unit k = population/sample pick a randomo number between 1 and k for staring     | quick to use        | need sampling frame           |
| Stratified    | sample represent group of a population sample/population\*strata for each strata, pick randomly | reflect popoulation | population must be classified |

```
*   Non Random
```

| Quota      | pick a representive from a group | no sampling frame easy to comparasion | nonrandom potential bias |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Oppotunity | Quota for avaliable              | Easy/ cheap                           | unlikely to representive |

```
*   Types of data

    *   Qualitative

        non numerical
    *   Quantative

        numerical either continuous or dscrete

    mutally exclusive vs independent

winder rainer - coastal

warmer sunshine - south

*   calculate range

    including outliner

    Sxx Variation

    Ex^2/n - (Ex/n)^2)^1/2
*   comment on correlation.

    because of negative correlation, lower than average

Hypothesis testing l normal

*   independent

    A N B = AxB
