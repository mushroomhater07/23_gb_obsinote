# purify ethyl ethanoate

* Reaction scheme
* Risk assessment
* Apparatus list and diagram (Read 2d - select the appropriate equipment!)&#x20;
* &#x20;Synthesis method (provided)  Ethanol + Acetic acid → ethyl ethanoate + water //esterification
* Purification method (You need to plan this. Including the amounts/volumes of material used)

1. Propan-1-ol (50 cm3 ) and ethanoic acid (50 cm3 ) are mixed thoroughly in a 250 cm3 round-bottomed flask.
2. Concentrated sulfuric acid (10 cm3 ) is added drop by drop to the mixture, keeping the contents of the flask well-shaken and cooled in an ice-water bath.
3. When the acid has all been added, a reflux condenser is fitted to the flask and the mixture gently boiled over an electric heating mantle for about 30 minutes.
4. The mixture is cooled, and the apparatus rearranged for distillation. The crude ester (about 60 cm3 ) is distilled off.

### Seperating funnel

5. The distillate is placed in a separating funnel and shaken with about half its volume of 30% sodium carbonate solution, with the pressure being released at intervals. The lower aqueous layer is then discarded.
6. The crude ester is shaken in a separating funnel with about half its volume of 50% calcium chloride solution, which removes unreacted alcohol. The lower layer is discarded.
7. The ester is run into a clean, dry flask containing some anhydrous _calcium chloride_ and swirled.\[appear clear]

### distill 2

8. The ester is filtered into a clean, dry flask, with a few anti- bumping granules, and distilled. The fraction boiling between 100°C and 103°C is collected Distillation

* Results and observations (density, Yield, colour, and states of matter) Mass ethyl ethanoate \`Mr = 12_4 + 16_2+6 = 48+38= 86gmol-1
* Analysis (compare experimental results to researched literature data, values, and observations. Remember to reference the data source with date and time used).

* The boiling point of ethyl ethanoate is 74.1°C.
* The boiling point of water is 100°C.
* Calcium chloride and anhydrous sodium sulfate are both effective desiccants.
