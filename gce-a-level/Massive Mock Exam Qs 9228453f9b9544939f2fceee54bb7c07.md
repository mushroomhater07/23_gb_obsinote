# Massive Mock Exam Qs

Phenol is an acid // carboxylic acid is also an acid

- enthapy of vapourism = endothermic
    
    energy requires to overcome induced dipole dipole forces and london forces
    
- Organic layer colour change explain reactivity
    - Result: Cls replace Br-
    - Write out equation / ioinc equation
- Electronegaticity
    - Size/ shell/ sheilding(more radius
    - reactivity (down the gp decrease)(less energy release)
    - attraction(less nuclear attraction
- obtain sample of solid from liquid/ aq states
    - Sepearation of solid - filter out
    - removal of water - dry/ evaporate
- standard solution
    
    solution with known concentration
    
- titration
    
    concordant result within 0.1cm3
    
    Assumption: only ethanoic acid and **no other acid**
    
- stereoisomer
    
    â†’ same structural  formula but different arrange in space
    
    optical isomerism = chiral carbon atom
    
- strural isomer
    
    E- flatZ 
    
    cis-trans
    
- rate of reaction graph
- Buffer calculation + buffer neutralisation

| Na2CO3 | affect carboxylic acid only |
| --- | --- |
| NaOH | affect phenol + carboxylic acid |
| Br2 | affect phenol |
